# Codewars Kata - Personal Collection - C# (dotnet core 2.0+) / Python3

A personal collection of the [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) kata (challenges) that I have completed, skill level is denoted by folder numbering, harder is lower in numbering, refer to this [Chart](https://www.codewars.com/docs) to find the exact collection of rankings.

## Basic usage

If the folder contains an .sln please use your favorite IDE/compiler for dotnet C#, build and run. For .py please use python3.
